            Kevork’s passion for both modern and classic design was fostered
            growing up in Europe and the U.S. and receiving his education at
            Cooper Union in New York City and in Basel, Switzerland. Before
            founding Dekker Babian, Kevork created identity programs and
            marketing communications for clients including NASA, Champion
            Papers, the FAA, and Ward Bennett for Brickell Furniture. Kevork is

            Townhouse.bz - a Dekker Babian business
          </div>
          <p className="pb-4">
            In 2010, Dekker Babian launched Townhouse.bz as an opportunity to
            sell fabulous mid-century modern furniture, objects and art, and
            also as a forum for an on-going discussion about the aesthetics,
            history, and abiding significance of modernist design. We aim to
            mesh high style, value, and sustainability in a manner that
            addresses broader concerns about the environmental and economic
            challenges faced by the world today. Townhouse’s successful launch
            was heralded by the New York Times Home section. Through
            Townhouse.bz, Dekker Babian develops websites, social media and
            print catalogs for artists as well as curates art and design events.
